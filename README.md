# E-Commerce-Sales-Trends-Dashboard
Objective : Analyze online product performance.

This project aims to analyze online product performance using an E-Commerce Diwali Sales Dataset.

The goal is to understand customer purchasing behavior, sales patterns, and revenue trends across different demographics, product categories, and payment methods.
The dataset used contains attributes such as User_ID, Gender, Age, State, Zone, Occupation, Product_Category, Orders, Unit Price, Amount, Revenue, Discount(%), Final_Price, Payment_Mode, Delivery_Status, Device_Used, and Rating. Both raw and cleaned data were processed through data cleaning and data preprocessing steps in Excel, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

Objectives of the Project:

            1. To identify the most profitable products and categories.
            2. To examine customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, occupation) affecting sales.
            3. To observe regional trends in revenue generation (by state and zone).
            4. To analyze how discounts and payment modes impact overall sales.
            5. To evaluate customer satisfaction through product ratings.
            6. To create a dynamic dashboard using Excel to visualize insights effectively.

Tools & Techniques Used:

            1. Microsoft Excel
            2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
            3. Pivot Tables for summarization
            4. Slicers for interactive filtering
            5. Sparklines for quick visual trends
            6. Multiple chart types (Bar, Column, Pie, Scatter, Donut, Line) for visualization

Key Features of the Dashboard:

            1. Revenue by Gender: Identifies which gender contributes more to total sales.
            2. Revenue by Zone (Pie Chart): Displays regional performance.

            6. Revenue by State (Donut Chart): Visualizes state-wise contribution.
            7. Interactive Slicers: Filter by Zone, Gender, Age Group, and Product Category to view dynamic results.

Outcome:

The analysis provides meaningful insights into consumer behavior and product performance, helping businesses make data-driven decisions such as optimizing inventory, improving pricing strategies, and targeting high-performing customer segments.
